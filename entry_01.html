    <h2>On Being Asexual</h2>

    <p>I came out as asexual to my friends in 2020. It took me some confusing, stressful weeks during high school and one awkward breakup to truly accept it for myself. If DC is reading this by some slim chance (probably about the same odds as me winning the lottery without buying a ticket), I hope you are doing well, and I forgive you for not accepting my identity; I should have informed you better. And I'm sorry it ended that way.
      <br><br>
At the time of writing, I have exactly 1 previous relationship. It happened when I was near the end of my high school years and lasted about 8 months. He was from a different high school, a private school, way up north. 
<br><br>
Beyond kissing and such, the most intimate we've gotten was sleeping in the same sleeping bag when I was invited to go camping with his friends for New Years. Nothing happened, though he told me I gave him 'blue balls' (first time I heard the term, btw) and then went to relieve himself in the bathroom. I didn't think much of this, just teenage boys being teenage boys. There was also an incident where he asked to feel my breasts when we were hanging out, and so I let him, over my shirt and bra, which is pretty weird in retrospective. He didn't ask to feel UNDER them so ...
<br><br>
I eventually ended the relationship because he kept asking for sex. 
<br><br>
"When are we going to do it?"
<br><br>
I didn't know what to say at first. I honestly didn't know. That's not something I wanted, or even thought about consciously. I wanted to say never? But that felt a bit cruel; and that's not normal? Normal people have sex in their teen years. It's like a rite of passage. I shouldn't deny him of this experience just because I didn't want to. But I don't want to have sex in the foreseeable future, so there must be something wrong with me... Because that's not normal... So I delayed it. I told him 'I don't know' to fend him off for at least a little bit.
<br><br>
But inwardly, this was an identity crisis. Was it wrong of me to be like this? What could be the cause? Was it the way I was brought up? My culture?
<br><br>
Researching on the internet during sleepless nights brought a new term to my attention. "Asexual". Someone who does not experience sexual attraction, or only in certain circumstances.
<br><br>
Is that what I am? Is that a bad thing? As a 17 year old, I felt very conflicted about this label. It kinda fits me, but it sounded like a bad thing. It sounded... abnormal? It wasn't good to stand out.
<br><br>
In the mean time, the nagging didn't stop. What could I say or do to make him understand?
<br><br>
"I don't think I want to do it",
"It's not something I'm interested in",
"I think I'm asexual"
<br><br>
He didn't believe me. He told me that it wasn't a real thing. This was devastating. I doubted myself even more, but I wasn't going to change my mind about this. Not after all this. I can't provide what he wants, needs, from me.
<br><br>
We couldn't be in this relationship anymore.
<br><br>
But my formal was coming up. And he already bought tickets. I had to wait.
<br><br>
He was my date for a very awkward formal. I was actively avoiding my date to spend time with my friends, and he noticed. We did dance eventually, but my mind felt hazy, and almost like I was watching this as someone else. I was putting on a show. For him.
<br><br>
I broke up with him the week after over messages. I asked him if he wanted to be friends still, he declined. Then I blocked him on every social platform, deleted photos of us together. I felt bad about such a sudden breakup for a little bit, but after a while, it was like a switch had been flipped. He shouldn't have doubted me. I told him exactly what I felt, gave him a term to do research on, but he denied my feelings. He was upset because I couldn't give him what he wanted, after all this time. Nothing to show for his efforts. That didn’t sound like someone I’d like to be with.
<br><br>
Enough about my past. Let’s talk about now. Being ace is funny sometimes; when my friends talk about sex, I almost always have a moment of ’Oh, yeah’ as I am reminded that it is something people do, all the time. It’s just not something I think about. 
<br><br>
When I consume sexual content, it’s almost equivalent to doing some research on, say, deep sea creatures. I see it as research. People have sex all the time, this is a fact, just as true as the fact that these weird sea creatures exist on the same planet, at the same time as us. Sometimes I get curious; I like to know things.
<br><br>
Sometimes it can be a bit isolating. It is hard to find a person who accepts the fact that sex is not going to be part of the relationship. This sounds a lot like friendship, but friends don’t share the rest of their lives with you. At this point, I’ve accepted that I’m going to be by myself for the rest of my life. It might sound sad, but honestly, it has its perks (as well as downsides, just as life with a partner).
<br><br>
I don’t know what sexual attraction feels like. When I say ‘that person is hot’ compared to when an allo person say the same, we probably mean different things. Do allo people really see someone, and want to have sex with them? That’s how sexual attraction was described to me, but I have not idea whether that is accurate.
