 <h2>On DOROHEDORO - Intro & Music</h2>
    <p>DOROHEDORO tells the story of Kaiman (Caiman), a strange, amnesiac man(?) with the head of a reptile. He lives in Hole, a place where magic-users come to practice their magic on humans, often disfiguring or killing them. Kaiman hunts these magic-users, and uses the man inside his mouth that only magic-users can see, to try to find the person that caused his own transformation.</p>

    <p>You can expect to see dark themes, VIOLENCE, body horror, surrealism, strong women, GORE.</p>

    <p>If you are intrigued by this, there’s a good anime adaptation of it on Netflix.</p>

    <p>I found this series through the anime, but since it only covered a small portion of the story, I went and sought out the manga. I read it in 2 days because I was so absorbed by it. I couldn’t get enough of the characters, the world, the art.</p>

    <p>The manga soundtrack (yes, you read that right, <em>manga</em>soundtrack) is also banging. The most heavy, grimy, down-right dirty breakcore and industrial sounds I ever heard. It fits the story SO well. It was a super limited-release on 2 CDs from 2016, and OUGH how I wish to track down a physical copy that's not INSANELY expensive. I am content in just having the FLAC files for now.</p>

    <p>The anime soundtrack retains the general 'shape' and vibe of its manga counterpart, but it's been toned down as to better fit a different form of media. It was released in 2020 along with the anime, and much more accessible <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2LlKseD9In6F377qHat4uZ?si=HfGuJSKnSKGj3Kt7Kl4Mqg">[Spotify]</a>.</p>

    <p>A music group specialising in animation soundtracks produced the OST for the anime, whereas the manga OST was a collection of songs from various artists. The author, Q Hayashida, undoubtedly had a hand in both productions.</p>

    <p> Q Hayashida, is also sneaker head and you can see it in the straight fire shoes her characters wear.</p>
